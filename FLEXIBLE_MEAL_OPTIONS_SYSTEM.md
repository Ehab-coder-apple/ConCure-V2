# Flexible Meal Options System

## Overview
The new Flexible Meal Options system revolutionizes nutrition planning by moving away from rigid day-by-day schedules to a flexible option-based approach. Instead of prescribing specific meals for each day, doctors create **meal options** for each meal type that patients can choose from throughout the week.

## Key Concept

### Traditional Approach (Day-Based):
```
Day 1: Breakfast A, Lunch A, Dinner A, Snack A
Day 2: Breakfast B, Lunch B, Dinner B, Snack B
Day 3: Breakfast C, Lunch C, Dinner C, Snack C
...
```

### New Flexible Approach (Option-Based):
```
Breakfast Options: Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, Option 4
Lunch Options: Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, Option 4  
Dinner Options: Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, Option 4
Snack Options: Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, Option 4
```

**Patient chooses:** Any breakfast option + Any lunch option + Any dinner option + Any snack option for each day.

## Benefits

### For Doctors:

- **Professional**: Modern approach to nutrition planning

### For Clinics:

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

## Routes and Controllers

### New Routes:
```php
Route::get('/create/flexible', 'createFlexible')->name('create.flexible');
Route::post('/store-flexible', 'storeFlexible')->name('store-flexible');
```

### New Controller Methods:
- `createFlexible()`: Display flexible plan creation form
- `storeFlexible()`: Process and save flexible meal plan

## Data Structure Example

### Flexible Plan Structure:
```json
{
  "breakfast": [
    {
      "option_number": 1,
      "option_description": "High Protein Breakfast",
      "foods": [
        {"food_name": "Eggs", "quantity": 100, "unit": "g"},
        {"food_name": "Whole Wheat Toast", "quantity": 50, "unit": "g"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "option_number": 2,
      "option_description": "Light Breakfast",
      "foods": [
        {"food_name": "Greek Yogurt", "quantity": 150, "unit": "g"},
        {"food_name": "Berries", "quantity": 80, "unit": "g"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "lunch": [...],
  "dinner": [...],
  "snacks": [...]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Weight Loss Plan
**Breakfast Options:**
- Option 1: Oatmeal with fruits (300 cal)

- Option 3: Vegetable omelet (280 cal)

**Patient Week:**
- Monday: Option 1 + Lunch Option 2 + Dinner Option 1 + Snack Option 3
- Tuesday: Option 2 + Lunch Option 1 + Dinner Option 3 + Snack Option 1
- Wednesday: Option 3 + Lunch Option 3 + Dinner Option 2 + Snack Option 2
- etc.

### Example 2: Diabetic Plan
**Lunch Options:**
- Option 1: Grilled chicken salad (Low carb)
- Option 2: Lentil soup with vegetables (Complex carbs)
- Option 3: Fish with quinoa (Balanced)
- Option 4: Turkey wrap (Moderate carbs)

## Migration Path

### Backward Compatibility:
- Existing day-based plans continue to work normally
- `is_option_based` flag distinguishes between plan types
- Both systems can coexist in the same database
- No data migration required for existing plans

### Gradual Adoption:
- Doctors can choose between traditional and flexible approaches
- Patients can have both types of plans
- System automatically uses appropriate templates and interfaces

## Best Practices
