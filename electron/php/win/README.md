Optional bundled PHP runtime for Windows

- Place a PHP build here as php.exe with its dependencies, e.g.:
  electron/php/win/php.exe
  electron/php/win/ext/*
  electron/php/win/*.dll

If present, the app will prefer this runtime on Windows for a oneâ€‘click setup.
If absent, the app will fall back to system PHP in PATH.
