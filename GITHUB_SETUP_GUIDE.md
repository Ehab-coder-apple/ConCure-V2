## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Prepare the Project
```bash
# Run the preparation script
./prepare-github.sh
```

This script will:
- Clean up development files and databases
- Remove sensitive data
- Set proper file permissions
- Validate critical files
- Create initialization scripts

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click "New repository"** or visit https://github.com/new
3. **Repository settings:**
   - Repository name: `concure` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "ConCure Clinic Management System - Comprehensive healthcare management platform"
   - Visibility: Choose Public or Private based on your needs
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have these already)

### Step 3: Initialize Local Repository
```bash
# Run the initialization script
./init-github-repo.sh

# Then follow the displayed instructions to connect to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/concure.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Configure Repository Settings

#### Branch Protection
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

#### Security Settings
1. Go to Settings → Security & analysis
2. Enable:
   - ✅ Dependency graph
   - ✅ Dependabot alerts
   - ✅ Dependabot security updates
   - ✅ Secret scanning (if available)

#### Collaborators
1. Go to Settings → Manage access
2. Add team members with appropriate permissions:
   - **Admin**: Full access
   - **Write**: Can push to non-protected branches
   - **Read**: Can view and clone repository

### Step 5: Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

The CI/CD workflow is already configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. To enable:

1. Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. Enable GitHub Actions if prompted
3. The workflow will run automatically on pushes and pull requests

#### Required Secrets (if using CI/CD)
Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions and add:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` (if using code coverage)
- Any deployment-specific secrets

### Step 6: Configure Issue Templates

Issue templates are already set up in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- Bug reports with healthcare-specific fields
- Feature requests with user story templates

### Step 7: Set Up Project Documentation

#### Update README.md
Replace placeholder URLs in README.md:
```markdown
# Replace these placeholders:
https://github.com/your-username/concure
support@connectpure.com
https://connectpure.com
```

#### Add Screenshots
1. Create `docs/screenshots/` directory
2. Add screenshots of:
   - Welcome page
   - Dashboard
   - Patient management
   - Prescription system
   - Mobile views

## 🏥 Healthcare-Specific Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance Notice
Add this notice to your repository description:
> "Healthcare management system designed with HIPAA compliance considerations. Proper configuration and deployment required for production use with patient data."

### Security Considerations
- Enable private repository if handling sensitive development data
- Use GitHub's security features (secret scanning, dependency alerts)
- Regular security audits and updates
- Proper access control for team members

### Documentation Requirements
- User manuals for healthcare staff
- Compliance documentation
- Security procedures
- Data handling policies

## 📊 Repository Management

### Branching Strategy
Recommended Git flow:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development integration branch
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

### Release Management
1. Use semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1)
2. Create releases through GitHub Releases
3. Include changelog in release notes
4. Tag releases appropriately

### Issue Management
- Use labels for categorization (bug, enhancement, security, etc.)
- Healthcare-specific labels (patient-data, clinical-workflow, compliance)
- Assign issues to team members
- Use milestones for version planning

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Repository Security
- Enable two-factor authentication for all contributors
- Use signed commits for sensitive changes
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for leaked secrets

### Code Security
- Never commit sensitive data (.env files, keys, passwords)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regular dependency updates
- Security-focused code reviews

## 📞 Support and Maintenance

### Community Management
- Respond to issues promptly
- Maintain professional communication
- Provide clear contribution guidelines
- Regular updates and maintenance

### Professional Support
- Set up support channels (email, documentation)
- Create FAQ documentation
- Provide installation and setup guides
- Maintain changelog and release notes
