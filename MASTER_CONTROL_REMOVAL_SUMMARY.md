    // ...
];

public function canManageUsers(): bool
{
    return in_array($this->role, ['program_owner', 'admin']);
}
```

**After:**
```php
const ROLES = [
    'admin' => 'Admin',
    // ...
];

public function canManageUsers(): bool
{
    return $this->role === 'admin';
}
```

### 2. Authorization Gates (`app/Providers/ConCureServiceProvider.php`)
**Changes Made:**
- Updated all authorization gates to use admin role only
- Removed program_owner from all gate definitions

**Examples:**
```php
// Before
Gate::define('manage-users', function (User $user) {
    return in_array($user->role, ['program_owner', 'admin']);
});

// After
Gate::define('manage-users', function (User $user) {
    return $user->role === 'admin';
});
```

### 3. Route Configuration
**Files Modified:**
- `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` - Removed master routes loading
- `routes/web.php` - Removed master control route groups and controller imports

### 4. HTTP Kernel (`app/Http/Kernel.php`)
**Changes Made:**
- Removed master authentication middleware registrations
- Cleaned up middleware aliases

### 5. Controllers Updated
**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/ExternalLabController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated role checks to use admin only
- Removed program_owner access logic

### 6. Database Schema
**Migration Created:** `2024_12_19_000001_remove_program_owner_role.php`

**Actions Performed:**
- Converted all existing program_owner users to admin role
- Updated user role enum (application-level enforcement for SQLite)
- Added audit log entry for the migration

**Original Migration Updated:** `database/migrations/2024_01_01_000001_create_users_table.php`
- Removed program_owner from role enum definition

### 7. Documentation
**Files Updated:**
- `README.md` - Updated role descriptions
- Created `MASTER_CONTROL_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` (this document)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Role Hierarchy Changes
**Before:**
```
program_owner (highest) → admin → doctor → assistant → nurse → accountant → patient
```

**After:**
```
admin (highest) → doctor → assistant → nurse → accountant → patient
```

### Permission Changes
All permissions previously granted to `program_owner` are now exclusively available to `admin` users:

- ✅ User management
- ✅ Activation code management
- ✅ Advertisement management
- ✅ Food composition management (shared with doctors)
- ✅ System settings
- ✅ Audit logs access
- ✅ Financial management (shared with accountants)

### Database Migration Results
```sql
-- Users with program_owner role converted to admin
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE role = 'program_owner';

-- Audit log entry created
INSERT INTO audit_logs (...) VALUES (
    'system_migration',
    'Removed program_owner role and converted existing program_owner users to admin role'
);
```

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### ✅ Functionality Tests
1. **Admin Login**: ✅ Working correctly
2. **User Management**: ✅ Admin-only access confirmed
3. **System Settings**: ✅ Admin-only access confirmed
4. **Authorization Gates**: ✅ All gates updated and working
5. **Database Migration**: ✅ Completed successfully
6. **Application Startup**: ✅ No errors, all routes working

### ✅ Security Tests
1. **Route Access**: ✅ No master control routes accessible
2. **Middleware**: ✅ Master auth middleware removed
3. **Role Validation**: ✅ Only admin role has system management access
4. **Data Integrity**: ✅ All existing data preserved

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### 🔒 Enhanced Security
- **Simplified Access Control**: Single admin role instead of dual control system
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Fewer authentication endpoints
- **Cleaner Authorization**: Consistent role-based access throughout application

### 🧹 Code Simplification
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removed dual authentication system
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Eliminated master control specific code
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single role hierarchy to manage

### 👥 Improved User Experience
- **Single Login**: Users only need clinic credentials
- **Consistent Interface**: All management through clinic dashboard
- **Simplified Onboarding**: No separate master control setup required

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **✅ Test all admin functionality** - Completed
2. **✅ Verify user management works** - Completed
3. **✅ Confirm authorization gates** - Completed

### Future Considerations
1. **User Training**: Update documentation for admin users
2. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure regular database backups
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor admin access patterns
4. **Documentation**: Update user manuals to reflect changes

## 📊 Impact Summary

| Aspect | Before | After | Status |
